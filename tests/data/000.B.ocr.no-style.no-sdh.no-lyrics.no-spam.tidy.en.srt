1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,001
'Senator', we're making
our 'final' approach into 'Coruscant'.

2
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:00,002
"Senator", we're making
our "final" approach into "Coruscant".

3
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:00,003
"Senator", "we"'re making
our "final" approach into "Coruscant".

4
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:00,004
now I only ask,
I can only ask. So do I

5
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:00,005
It shouldn't be you. It should be me.

6
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:00,006
I haven't done that.

7
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:00,007
And if I refuse?

8
00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:00,008
- Francine, what happened?
- I don't know. You should tell me!

9
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:00,009
Do you believe him?

10
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:00,010
Do you believe him?

11
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,011
Do you believe him?

12
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:00,012
Do you believe him?

13
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:00,013
Do you believe him?

14
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:00,014
Do you believe him?

15
00:00:00,014 --> 00:00:00,015
Do you believe him?

16
00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:00,016
Do you believe him?

17
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:00,017
I've never done this
with the power so low before.

18
00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:00,018
It's okay. I'm with you.

19
00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:00,019
But you don't
need to be a nuclear scientist

20
00:00:00,019 --> 00:00:00,020
At 28 minutes past midnight,

21
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:00,026
Comrade Khomyuk.

22
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:00,038
A beauty from beyond the Wall.

23
00:00:00,038 --> 00:00:00,039
Oh, if you were my girl,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

24
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:00,040
Right.

25
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,041
- Turn her over.
- All right.

26
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,042
- Valar Morghulis.
- Valar Dohaeris.

27
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:00,050
Foo bar.

28
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,051
"FooBar"...

29
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,921
Previously on 11.22.63...

30
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:48,549
- I forget everything when I'm reading.
- "From Here to Eternity."

31
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,476
The day that changed my life.

32
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,574
Cigars? Cigarettes?

33
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,880
Cersei controls fewer than
half the Seven Kingdoms.

34
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:57,446
Can you write a letter to the principal?

35
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,656
- Hi.
- How are you?

36
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,139
Get out of here.

37
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,641
"The prince who was
promised will bring the dawn."

38
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,376
In the 1930s...

39
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,618
I delivered his bones myself.
